## Fake News Detection using LSTM

In this project, we leverage Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), for the task of fake news detection. LSTMs are well-suited for sequential data, making them effective in analyzing text-based information.

### Why LSTM?

LSTMs excel at capturing long-range dependencies in sequences, making them particularly powerful for tasks involving natural language processing. In the context of fake news detection, LSTM helps the model understand the context and relationships between words in a sentence or paragraph.

### How LSTMs Contribute:

1. **Sequential Understanding:** LSTMs can grasp the sequential patterns and relationships in textual data, allowing the model to discern nuances and context in language.

2. **Memory Retention:** The architecture of LSTMs includes a memory cell, which enables the network to selectively remember or forget information over time, crucial for understanding the evolving nature of fake news.

3. **Feature Extraction:** LSTMs automatically learn and extract relevant features from the input data, helping the model identify intricate patterns indicative of fake or misleading content.
